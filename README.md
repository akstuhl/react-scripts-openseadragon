# react-scripts-openseadragon

This package is identical to react-scripts except for the addition of a shim for OpenSeadragon to the webpack configuration. This shim has been added for the convenience of developers who wish to include OpenSeadragon plugins (e.g. openseadragon-paperjs-overlay) in their create-react-app projects without running the eject script.

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
